Hello!

**About me:**

I am Emman, a 4th Year Student, Bachelor of Computer Science Major in Software Technology. I have an interest in Game Development, Game Design, and asset creation (2D and 3D). Most of the works (that I think are noteworthy) usually involve these interests.

Aside from that I've mostly done Front-End Development work in the other projects I was involved in.
